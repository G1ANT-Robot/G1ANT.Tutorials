# Excel Without Excel

Sometimes you need to process an Excel file, but you don’t have MS Office to open it. Instead of resorting to Microsoft’s suite alternatives such as LibreOffice or Google Docs, or online converters, you can use our Xlsx Addon, which allows performing some actions on spreadsheet data without having Excel installed. So, enable the addon in the Addons panel and try it!

The following script is a simple XLSX to CSV file converter to show the idea of the addon: the robot will download a sample Excel spreadsheet file *excel.xlsx* to a user Desktop, then will open it with the `xlsx.open` command and start processing. Row by row (the `for` loop with the `♥rowNo` variable) and cell by cell in each row (the `for` loop with the `♥columnNo` variable) the robot reads the values with the `xlsx.getvalue` command and adds them to the already read ones, putting a comma at the end of the new data (`♥value = ♥value♥result,`).

When a full row is read (the `♥columnNo` variable in the `for` loop reaches 7), the `♥newline` special variable is added to the comma-separated values of the row (`♥value = ♥value‴♥newline‴`), making a new line for the values that will be read from the next row.

After all rows were read, the content of the `♥value` variable is written to an *output.csv* file on the Desktop.

```G1ANT
♥value = ‴‴
♥file = ♥environment⟦USERPROFILE⟧\Desktop\excel.xlsx
file.download https://github.com/G1ANT-Robot/G1ANT.Manual/raw/develop/-assets/excel.xlsx filename ♥file
xlsx.open ♥file
for ♥rowNo from 1 to 11
  for ♥columnNo from 1 to 7
    xlsx.getvalue ♥rowNo colindex ♥columnNo
    ♥value = ♥value♥result,
  end
  ♥value = ♥value‴♥newline‴
end
text.write ♥value filename output.csv
```

The code above has one limitation: the data range (number of columns and rows filled with data) must be known in order to set the appropriate counters in both `for` loops.
