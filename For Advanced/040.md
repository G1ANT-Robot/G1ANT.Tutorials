# Message in a Robot

Email processing is a very important element in many RPA solutions. Let’s see how you can do it in G1ANT.Robot.

The most universal email command is the `mail.imap` command from the Net Addon — in order to use it, you need to enable the addon in the Addons panel to the left of the script editor: just click the check box next to the **net** entry to select it.

Suppose you want to retrieve today’s emails from your Gmail account and see their subjects:

```G1ANT
♥login = enter your Gmail login here
♥password = enter your Gmail password here

mail.imap imap.gmail.com login ♥login password ♥password sincedate ♥date onlyunreadmessages true ignorecertificateerrors true result ♥list 

foreach ♥element in ♥list
  dialog ♥element
end
```

The `mail.imap` command logs in to your email account with provided credentials (your `♥login` and `♥password`) and retrieves emails received today (the `♥date` special variable returns the current date for the `sincedate` argument). The messages are stored as a list in the `♥list` variable. They are picked from there one by one and displayed in the `foreach` loop.

In this script, the robot displays only the mail subject. If you want to see other message elements — sender name, message body, attachments and so forth — you need to dig a bit deeper in the message list. And this is what you’re about to do in the next lesson.
