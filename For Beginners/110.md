# List Your Variables

Variables are not limited to one element. They can contain many elements — numbers, texts, other variables (or rather their values) — in a structure called a list. Run this script:

```G1ANT
♥list = Adam❚Eva❚John❚Mary
dialog ♥list
```

In the resulting dialog box you will see four names and two numbers contained in the `♥list` variable. They are separated with another special character: `❚` (available by pressing **Ctrl+\\** or selecting it from the `Insert` menu). This separator tells the robot that this is a list and shows where its elements are.

Lists are a very convenient storage for various data, since you can use just some of their elements if needed. For example, run this script:

```G1ANT
♥list = Adam❚Eva❚John❚Mary
dialog ♥list⟦2⟧
```

The dialog displays only `Eva`. It's because of `⟦2⟧` parameter added to the `♥list` variable at the end of the code. The number inside double brackets `⟦` and `⟧` (available by pressing **Ctrl+\[** or selecting it from the `Insert` menu) is called _index_ and points to a specific element in a list. In this case, the second element — `Eva`. Experiment replacing `2` in the code above with other indices.

Now enter `count` between the double brackets and run the script:

```G1ANT
♥list = Adam❚Eva❚John❚Mary
dialog ♥list⟦count⟧
```

You will see `4` in the resulting dialog box, because `count`, as its name implies, counts elements in a list.

The next lesson will show you more operations you can perform on lists.
