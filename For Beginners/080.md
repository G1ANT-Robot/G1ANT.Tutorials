# Repetitive Tasks as Procedures 

Sometimes identical parts of the code are used in several places. You can change them into a procedure and then just call it where needed.

In the example from the previous lesson you can take the code responsible for changing the font size (opening the `Font` dialog and entering new font size there), turn it into a procedure named `changefont`, and then call it from within the loop, which increases the `♥fontsize` variable:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard Hello⋘enter⋙world!
for ♥fontsize from 10 to 100 step 10
    call changefont
end

procedure changefont
	keyboard ⋘alt+o⋙f
	window font
	keyboard ⋘tab 2⋙♥fontsize⋘enter⋙
end
```

In the next lesson you will learn how to call a procedure with a parameter.
