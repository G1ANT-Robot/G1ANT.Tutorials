# Looping Things

Now you are about to do something more complicated — like font size animation, for instance.

At first, the font size will be **10**, then it should increase gradually to **100** with a step equal to **10**. This can be achieved with a `for` loop:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard Hello⋘enter⋙world!
for ♥fontsize from 10 to 100 step 10
	keyboard ⋘alt+o⋙f
	window font
	keyboard ⋘tab 2⋙♥fontsize⋘enter⋙
end
```

Note that the first declaration of the `♥fontsize` variable isn't necessary. It's starting value is set with the `from` argument. Also note the indents of lines inside the `for...end` loop: they aren't obligatory, but help you to spot the looped code.

Run the script and see your text growing automatically in Notepad.

In the next lesson you will learn how to make use of procedures.
