# What Else?

An `if`…`end` block is not limited to testing just one condition. You can also test other conditions within the same block, using the `else if` and the `else` commands.

Run this script:

```G1ANT
for ♥i from 1 to 5
  if ♥i==1
    dialog ‴One - to rule them all‴
  else if ♥i==2
    dialog ‴Two - to rule them, too‴
  else if ♥i==3
    dialog ‴Three - you will see‴
  else if ♥i==4
    dialog ‴Four - you were looking for‴
  else
    dialog ‴Five - time to jive‴
  end
end
```

As you can see, the flow is simple and straightforward: if the first condition is met, a dialog box with *“One - to rule them all”* message appears. If it’s not, then the second condition (`else if`) is tested — and so forth, until there is no other condition to test (you are left with only one option handled in the `else` block: the `♥i` variable equals 5).

The rule of the `else if` and the `else` commands is: If the first condition after the `if` command is not met, the robot will check whether the next condition after the `else if`command is met. It will repeat these actions as many times as there are `else if` commands in the block between the `if` and the `end` commands, or if one condition is finally met (then the robot will execute the block between the `else` commands).

If no condition is met, the robot will execute the command block between the `else` and `end` commands.

In the next lesson you will learn how to check the user input.
