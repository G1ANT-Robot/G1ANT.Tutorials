# Process

Open http://nseindia.com/corporates/content/eq_research_reports_listed.htm and for the first 50 companies, download a recent month’s report. Save it in a separate folder **Today’s date/Company Name/PDF Name.pdf**

# Steps to automate

1. Create variables - `url` storing the link given and `basePath` containing the path to the main folder

```G1ANT
♥url = http://nseindia.com/corporates/content/eq_research_reports_listed.htm
♥basePath = C:\Users\dell\Desktop\PDF Automation
```

2. Create a main procedure in which you open the website and call it after the initialised variables section

```G1ANT
call DownloadPdfFiles

procedure DownloadPdfFiles
    selenium.open chrome url ♥url
end procedure
```

3. Run the script and investigate the website yourself, open developer tools and find there the elements that are important (company names and the buttons to open their webpages)

After a quick investigation you should see that the company names are in the third column and you can get the first records by running these scripts in the developer tools console:

```js
document.getElementsByClassName("normalText")[2].innerText
document.getElementsByClassName("normalText")[6].innerText
document.getElementsByClassName("normalText")[10].innerText
```
Getting the buttons to open company webpages is quite similar. Here are examples of how you can open the first three of them:

```js
document.getElementsByClassName("normalText")[3].click()
document.getElementsByClassName("normalText")[7].click()
document.getElementsByClassName("normalText")[11].click()
```

You can notice that the index for each record increases by 4 and that the respective buttons' indexes are greater by 1 than the company names' indexes.
