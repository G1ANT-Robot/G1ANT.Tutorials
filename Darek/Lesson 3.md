#Lesson 3

You already know how to command applications with keyboard shortcuts. But often you need something more than just simple tasks involving keyboard: you need logic. This logic would allow you, for example, to perform repetitive tasks without dozens of lines of redundant code. Or to execute operations depending on conditions (do something if a condition is met, otherwise do something else). Logic does magic and makes the foundation for automatization.

Imagine you want to do the same task couple times â€” say, paste cliboard content 5 times in consecutive rows.
