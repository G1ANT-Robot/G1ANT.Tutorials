# Selecting Menu Items in an Application

You can do much more than just writing in Notepad. You can select its menu items, using keyboard shortcuts.

When you press left **Alt** key, you will see underlined letters in menu items names. These letters make keyboard shortcuts to their respective items. For example, if you want to change text font, you should press **Alt+O** to enter the `Format` menu, 
then **F** key to select `Font` item and open its dialog box.

Your robot script can do exactly the same:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard Hello⋘enter⋙world!
keyboard ⋘alt+o⋙f
```

In the next lesson you will learn how to make sure your robot stays focused on the right application window.
