# Using Variables

Do you remember variables? They are like named containers, which can store changing values. A variable named, say, _number_ can be equal to 1, 20, 0.18 or other number you put in it. A variable can also contain text or other types of data.

Run this script:

```G1ANT
♥number = 2
♥total = ♥number + ♥number
dialog ♥total
```

You will see a dialog box displaying `4`. In the first line you defined a `♥number` variable equal to `2`. In the next line you defined a `♥total` variable, which is a sum of two `♥number` variables. Since 2 and 2 make 4, the `dialog` command will bring up a dialog box showing `4` as the value of the `♥total` variable.

**Note:** The heart (`♥`) character is the prefix for all variables in G1ANT.Robot language. You can enter this character by pressing **Ctrl+4**. It's like `$` in PHP language.

In the next lesson you will see why some characters make huge difference for operations on variables.
