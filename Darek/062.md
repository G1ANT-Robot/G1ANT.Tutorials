# Practical Variable

Now that you know variables, make use of them in your amazing code for automatic font size changing in Notepad.

Assign font size equal to `10` to a variable named `♥fontsize`:

```G1ANT
♥fontsize = 10
program notepad
keyboard Hello⋘enter⋙world!
keyboard ⋘alt+o⋙f
window font
keyboard ⋘tab 2⋙♥fontsize⋘enter⋙
```

In the first line of your code you declare that the `♥fontsize` variable equals `10`. In the last line the value of this variable is used to define the font size.

As you can see, you can use `♥fontsize` in any text generated with the `keyboard` command.

In the next lesson you will see how loops work.
