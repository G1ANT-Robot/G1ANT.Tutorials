# Using Special Keys

Imagine you want to put _Hello_ and _world!_ in separate lines. Normally, you would just press **Enter** key after _Hello_. But how can you write this special key in a robot script? You have to use another special characters in G1ANT.Robot: triple quotation angles (`⋘` and `⋙`), which indicate a function key or a keyboard shortcut — **Enter** key in this example.

Press **Ctrl+<** and type `enter`inside the angles:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard ‴Hello!⋘enter⋙world!‴
```

Run the script. Now the words are in two lines.

Note that since there are no spaces in your text now, the triple quotation (`‴`) character is no longer needed and the second line could be reduced to this:

```G1ANT
keyboard Hello!⋘enter⋙world!
```

Delete the triple quotation characters and run the script. There are no errors and the output looks exactly the same.

In the next lesson you will tell the robot to use Notepad's menus.
