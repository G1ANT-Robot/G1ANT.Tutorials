# Replacing and Adding Elements to a List

Elements in a list are not there forever. You can replace them — just some or all — anytime using indices. Run this script:

```G1ANT
♥list = Adam❚Eva❚John❚Mary❚1❚200
♥list⟦1⟧ = Peter
dialog ♥list
```

The list has changed: now `Peter` is the first element, not `Adam`. It's because in the second line you told the robot to replace the first element of the `♥list` with `Peter`. Experiment with replacing other elements of the `♥list`.

You can also add an element to existing list:

```G1ANT
♥list = Adam❚Eva❚John❚Mary❚1❚200
dialog ♥list⟦count⟧
♥list⟦⟧ = Jack
dialog ♥list
dialog ♥list⟦count⟧
```

When you run this script, the first dialog box will display `6`, as there are that many elements in the list declared in the first line. The next dialog will show expanded list with a new element at its end — `Jack`, and the last dialog will present you with a new element count, which now equals `7`. The code responsible for the change is in the third line: the empty double brackets in `♥list⟦⟧ = Jack` cause adding `Jack` to the list `♥list`.
