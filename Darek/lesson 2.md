# Lesson 2

The `keyboard` command you used in the previous lesson is not that primitive as you might think. Well, it is, considering the way it works, but these simple keyboard inputs are much more powerful when you start using keyboard shortcuts. Why? Because every program uses keyboard alternatives for its menus, tools and functions. You only need to find them and pass to your robot.

Let's go back to your simple Notepad robot. Its code looks like this:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard Hello!⋘enter⋙‴I am robot.‴
```

Now you could use common Windows shortcuts such as **Ctrl+C** (copy to clipboard), **Ctrl+S** (save to a file) or *Alt+F4" (close program) to make the robot perform respective tasks. But Notepad allows you to do many other things: all of its tools are accessible with keyboard alternatives, which show up after pressing *Alt* key.

Run your robot by pressing **F9** ou can investigate available options
