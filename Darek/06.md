Have you ever use variable? let's define font size to the variable ♥size. 
Remmber, ♥ character is the prefix for all variables. 
You can generate this char by pressing ctrl+$. It's like $ in php language.

```
♥size = 10
program notepad
keyboard ‴Hello<<<enter>>>World!‴
keyboard ‴<<<alt+f>>>o‴
window font
keyboard ‴<<<tab 2>>>♥size<<<enter>>>‴
```

As you see, you can use ♥size in any text.
