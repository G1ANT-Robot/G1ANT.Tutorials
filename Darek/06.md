# Using Variables

Do you remember variables? They are like named containers, which can store changing values. A variable, say, _number_ can be equal to 1, 20, 0.18 or other number you put in it. A variable can also contain text.

Let's assign font size equal to 10 to the variable named `♥fontsize`. 

**Note:** The heart (`♥`) character is the prefix for all variables in G1ANT.Robot language. You can enter this character by pressing **Ctrl+$**. It's like `$` in PHP language.

```G1ANT
♥fontsize = 10
program notepad
keyboard Hello⋘enter⋙world!
keyboard ⋘alt+o⋙f
window font
keyboard ⋘tab 2⋙♥fontsize⋘enter⋙
```

In the first line of your code you declare that the `♥fontsize` variable equals 10. In the last line the value of this variable is used to define the font size.

As you can see, you can use `♥fontsize` in any text generated with the `keyboard` command.

In the next lesson you will see how loops work.
