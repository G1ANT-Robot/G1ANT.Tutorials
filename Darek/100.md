# Jump Around

You can call a procedure, but when it ends, you always go back to the place where the call was executed from. And sometimes you don't want that — you just want to go to some other section of your code. The `jump` command does exactly that: it goes straight to a desired section, which should be labelled and preceded with `➜` character — to enter it, press **Ctrl+2**.

Try this:

```G1ANT
program notepad
➜start
keyboard 1
jump ➜start
```

Wow, an infinite loop! To stop it, press **Ctrl+F12**.
