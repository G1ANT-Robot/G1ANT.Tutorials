# Texts containing spaces

What would happen if you wanted to enter a little longer text in Notepad, for example: "Hello world!"? Let's see:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard Hello world!
```

Run this script. An error message appears. Why? Because texts containing spaces should look like this: ‴Hello world!‴.

To enter the special triple prime character `‴` embracing the text, press **ctrl** and apostrophe (**'**) key on the keyboard with US layout.

Edit the second line of your code, adding triple primes before and after the text and run the script:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard ‴Hello world!‴
```

Now the robot runs smoothly and your text is displayed properly.
