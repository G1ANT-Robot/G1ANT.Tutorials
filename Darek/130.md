# All Mixed Up

As you saw in the previous lesson, you can add and replace elements in lists. You have to be careful, however, when putting elements of a different type in one list. Let's add a number to your previous list containing names and then fetch this new element and use it in mathematical operation:

```G1ANT
♥list = Adam❚Eva❚John❚Mary
♥list⟦⟧ = 200
dialog ♥list
♥test = ♥list⟦5⟧+10
dialog ♥test
```

You added `200` at the end of the `♥list` as its fifth element, then you fetched this element to add it to `10` and assign the result to the `♥test` variable. You expected the second dialog would show `210`, but you saw `20010` instead. Why?

Variables can be of different _types_, for example: **integer** (integer numbers with no decimal point), **float** (numbers with decimal point), **text** (strings of alphanumerical characters), **bool** (boolean _true_ or _false_). When you create a list, the type of its first element defines the whole list's type.

In the example above, the first element of the list is text. Therefore, when you add any number to this list, it will be automatically converted by the G1ANT.Robot to a text type. This means `200` you added to `♥list` is treated as a string of characters, not actual number, so when you wanted to add `10` to it, the robot simply merged these two strings of text, producing `20010` instead of expected `210`.

In the next lesson you will learn how to use variables as parameters for operations on lists.
