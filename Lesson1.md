Hello, let's start learning how to code and do automations in G1ANT language.

Once you have G1ANT.Robot installed and opened, we are ready to write our first program together.

Okay so let's say that using Internet Explorer browser and Google Search, we want to find and open G1ANT website. 

The first thing that you should know about G1ANT language is that we use special characters. You can access them by clicking Insert and then choosing the character that you want to use from the Menu. Every character has its own shortcut of course. //tutaj pokazuję gdzie trzeba kliknąć

So, we need to write:
   
```
ie.open google.com
```

***ie.open*** is a command, "google.com" an argument. As you can see, to access Google website, we have to put the address of it in these triple quotation marks which is one of our special characters. I used shortcut CTRL+" but you can also insert it from the Menu by clicking here as I showed you a minute ago. //tutaj pokazuję to samo tak naprawdę

Let's launch it by pressing this button with a little robot image or by pressing F9 key on the keyboard. //pokazuję ikonkę robota, która uruchamia robota

G1ANT.Robot can operate in the background without having to display windows that it’s working on, to the user, but in order to have it shown, we need to use window command just like this:
