# Lesson 1 - First script

Hi, let's auotmate something. 
As you probably know, robotic process automation is the fastest way to control any desktop and web application,
even without strictly defined API.

OK, let's start our first automation. Enter:

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard Hello!
```

and press <F5> to execute your first script. As you see, there are the new notepad window appeared on your desktop.

The first command `program` executed windows notepad. 
In the same way you can execute any other application. 
Check `program calc` or `program c:\windows\system32\calc.exe`.
